wxEventType wxEVT_BUTTONBOX;

/**
    @class wxButtonBox

    A wxButtonBox is a row of adjacent segments, each of which can show a
    label and/or a bitmap and which can be selected by the user. It is similar
    to a group of toggle buttons or to a horizontal wxRadioBox, but looks like
    a single control and is also known as a "segmented control".

    The behaviour of the control is determined by its style, which can be one
    of wxBB_SELECT_ONE (the default), wxBB_SELECT_ANY or wxBB_MOMENTARY:

    - With wxBB_SELECT_ONE at most one segment is selected at any given time,
      as in a wxRadioBox, but, contrary to it, it's possible to have no
      selected segment at all (which is the initial state). Clicking on the
      selected segment doesn't deselect it, but still generates an event.
    - With wxBB_SELECT_ANY segments are independent of each other and each of
      them is toggled by clicking on it, as with wxToggleButton.
    - With wxBB_MOMENTARY segments are just buttons: they are never selected
      and clicking on them only generates an event.

    The API of this class follows the one of @c NSSegmentedControl from macOS,
    which is used to implement it in wxOSX/Cocoa port. All the other ports use
    a generic implementation built from a row of wxToggleButton or, for the
    segments having only a bitmap and no label, wxBitmapToggleButton controls.
    This implementation is available under the name of wxGenericButtonBox in
    all ports, including wxOSX, where it can be used instead of the native
    control if desired. In wxOSX/Cocoa the wxHAS_NATIVE_BUTTONBOX symbol is
    defined in @c wx/buttonbox.h, while in all the other ports wxButtonBox is
    just another name for wxGenericButtonBox.

    The segments are identified by their (0-based) index in all the functions
    below. Using an invalid index results in an assert failure.

    @note This class is not available in wxUniversal, as it doesn't provide
        wxBitmapToggleButton (the @c wxUSE_BUTTONBOX is always 0 there).

    Please note that wxButtonBox only emits wxEVT_BUTTONBOX events when the
    user clicks on a segment and never when the selection is changed
    programmatically.

    You can see wxButtonBox in action in @ref page_samples_widgets.

    This control can be created from XRC, see @ref xrc_wxbuttonbox for its
    format.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxBB_SELECT_ONE}
        At most one segment can be selected, this is the default. The same as
        @c NSSegmentSwitchTrackingSelectOne in macOS.
    @style{wxBB_SELECT_ANY}
        Any number of segments can be selected. The same as
        @c NSSegmentSwitchTrackingSelectAny in macOS.
    @style{wxBB_MOMENTARY}
        Segments are never selected, clicking them only generates the events.
        The same as @c NSSegmentSwitchTrackingMomentary in macOS.
    @endStyleTable

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxCommandEvent}
    @event{EVT_BUTTONBOX(id, func)}
        Process a wxEVT_BUTTONBOX event, generated when the user clicks on a
        segment. wxCommandEvent::GetInt() returns the index of the segment,
        wxCommandEvent::GetExtraLong() is 1 if the segment is selected after
        the click and 0 otherwise (it is always 1 for wxBB_MOMENTARY, meaning
        "clicked", and for wxBB_SELECT_ONE) and wxCommandEvent::GetString()
        returns its label.
